- **This project**: `~/Claude Projects/togethertattoo-site/` — the studio site (Jak + Pip)
- **Pip Tattoos**: `~/Claude Projects/piptattoo-site/` — Pip's tattoo site
- **Jak Rapmund**: `~/Claude Projects/jakrapmund-site/` — Jak's personal tattoo site

Memory locations:
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jakrapmund-Claude-Projects-togethertattoo-site/memory/`
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jakrapmund-Claude-Projects-piptattoo-site/memory/`
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jakrapmund-Claude-Projects-jakrapmund-site/memory/`

When you learn something that applies to the other sites (deployment patterns, shared content, design decisions), update those memory files too.
